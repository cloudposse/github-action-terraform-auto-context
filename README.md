This is a Github Action that will automatically update the `context.tf` file in the calling repo against the most recent version published by Cloud Posse. If a new version is detected, a Pull Request will be opened to update it.
If the repo version is found to be out of date, a pull request is opened to update it.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

Copy this repository's `.github/workflows/auto-context.yml` file into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Terraform Auto-context functionality.
This will cause Auto-context functionality to execute daily at the time specified by the `cron` option (all times are UTC).

If you'd like to modify the schedule of the Auto-context action, you can follow the standard [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) syntax, as detailed below:

```
schedule:
# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed

# Update README.md nightly at 4am UTC
- cron:  '0 4 * * *'
```

The default username and email address attached to the commits generated by the Auto-context action are `cloudpossebot` and `11232728+cloudpossebot@users.noreply.github.com`. If you would like to change these defaults, please set the `bot-name` and `bot-email` inputs in the workflow file:
```
with:
  bot-name: [name]
  bot-email: [email]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.




## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...
1. Copy this repository's `.github/workflows/auto-context.yml` file into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Terraform Auto-context functionality.
2. (Optional) Update the `main` pin inside `auto-context.yml` to a fixed version. Consult https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-auto-context/releases for a list of available versions.
