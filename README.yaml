# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Github Action Terraform Auto-context compares the `context.tf` file in the calling repo against the most recent version published by Cloud Posse.
  If the repo version is found to be out of date, a pull request is opened to update it.
# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Copy the `sample_workflow_file.yaml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Terraform Auto-context functionality.
  This will cause Auto-context functionality to execute daily at the time specified by the `cron` option (all times are UTC).

  If you'd like to modify the schedule of the Auto-context action, you can follow the standard [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) syntax, as detailed below:

  ```
  schedule:
  # Example of job definition:
  # .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
  # |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
  # |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
  # |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
  # |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
  # |  |  |  |  |
  # *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed

  # Update README.md nightly at 4am UTC
  - cron:  '0 4 * * *'
  ```

# Example usage
#examples: |-
